Described what we do at NAAMII and how we are committed towards OpenScience. This included my own experience with facing reproducibility issues when exploring relevant literature in Biplanar X-ray to 3D Shape Reconstruction and how we have tried to address that by providing an opensource framework to the community for other researchers to build upon.
