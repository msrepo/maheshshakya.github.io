Hi ðŸ‘‹! I an a Research Associate working on Computational Medical Imaging at NAAMII, Nepal, a non-profit research lab where i am supervised by [Dr. Bishesh Khanal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZfaUCG5h3xsC). My current work is around leveraging Low-cost medical imaging modalities such as X-rays and Ultrasounds and augment their capabilities with applications to health scenarios in Nepal. 


At NAAMII, we are striving to build a world-class center of excellence that works on research topics pertinent to Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries(LMICs) as well as lead-by-example about how countries like Nepal can also contribute to research and not just be a beneficiary.
